# Simulations

At this point hopefully you have a vague idea of how to run a simulation, but you probably have no idea how to define your own simulations.

The whole process starts by defining an optical system consisting of a beam and some elements that the beam will pass through. You define this system in a file with the `.toml` extension. This file format is called TOML. It's just a plain text file, so you can use any text editor you want, just make sure to save the file with the `.toml` extension. TOML has its own rules for how to write things, but I'll teach you everything you need to know.

Read on to learn how to define your own simulations!
