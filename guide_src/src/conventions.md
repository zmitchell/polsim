## Polarization orientation
Throughout this documentation you might see me say that the orientation of a beam is 45 degrees. There's a number of different ways to interpret this, so let's spell out exactly what *I* mean when I say that.

- The beam is traveling away from me.
- The +x-axis is pointed to the right, and corresponds to an angle of zero.
- All other angles are measured by rotating counter-clockwise from the +x-axis.

For example, if I say that a beam has an orientation of 90 degrees, that means that it is oriented along the +y-axis. In actuallity, the polarization of a beam is a line that extends out to infinity in both directions, so the polarization in the previous example would extend along both the +y- and -y-axes.

## Handedness
The handedness of a circularly polarized beam is defined using the right-hand rule. If the beam is traveling away from you, the polarization vector of a "right"-hand circularly polarized beam will rotate clockwise in the plane of the polarization.
